## A) Read and prepare the following text for in-class discussion:

   1. [Scientists Losing Data at a Rapid Rate](http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-losing-data-at-a-rapid-rate-1.14416)
      - Which research paper are they referring to in the text? **Hint** Take a look at the references.
      - According to the research paper, how much does data availability drop per year?
      - Contacted researchers say the data still exists, why is it considered lost?
      - What percentage of contacted researchers answered back?
      - How can authors organize and preserve data used in research papers?
      - Is willingness to share data increasing or decreasing among researchers?
