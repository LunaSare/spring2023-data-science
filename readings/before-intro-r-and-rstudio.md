**Day 1**
<!-- from https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/blob/main/readings/R-intro.md-->

## A) Set up your computer:

- Download and install OR update the [R base system](http://cran.rstudio.com/) to the latest version for your OS.
- Install OR update to the latest version of [R studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) Desktop for your OS, to work with R's base system.  
- Check your R setup:
  - Open RStudio
  - On the console, type the command `R.Version()`
  - This will display some information; teh last few lines of the output will display the version of R you have installed, the latest as of Jan 21, 2023 is:

  ```
  $version.string
    [1] "R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)"

  $nickname

    [1] "Innocent and Trusting"

  ```

- If you have any issues with installation, contact the instructors or attend office hours previous to the in-class session.

## B) Complete the pre-lecture R survey

  - Please complete the R survey by answering the questions on this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7ezGmngessFG3pa8Fg5tl9urCyRGZwRIYAaN34F9vKaMqjA/viewform).

## C) Read and prepare for in-class discussion the text ["Before We Start"](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html):
  - what is R?
  - what is Rstudio?
  - what is reproducibility?
  - why is r good for reproducibility?
  - what are other benefits of R?
  - What are the main panes of the Rstudio IDE?
  - Why is it a good practice to set up a working directory?
  - What is the R workspace?

**Day 2**

## D) Read and prepare for discussion [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745):
  - According to the paper, how much of their time do researchers spend coding?
  - How do the majority of researchers learn programming?
  - List some basic software development practices.
  - List down any concepts or words from the paper that you did not know of, along with their definitions.
  - For each number in `Box 1. Summary of Best Practices`, identify the best practices that you have implemented in the past, in general and for this class.

## E) **Optional - extra points** Watch the videos listed below. Open a new R file and as you watch the videos, follow along with the instructor and type down and run the code that is being demoed on the video. **Watching all videos takes ~ 55 min**. Hint: Watch the videos with a higher reproduction speed to save some time:
