## Instructions

- Create a new Rmd file, save it in your document folder with the name `"functions-prep.Rmd"`.
- After (or during) watching each video, write the code that is being explained by the virtual instructor in your Rmd file.
  - Give a subtitle (as a second level header indicated with two hastags followed by a blank space `## `) to the code section for each video.
  - Write each piece of code explained in the video in its own R chunk.
  - ⚠️ If the code gives an error or does not run, you can tell R not to run it by using the option `eval = FALSE` inside the R chunk:
  ````
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
  your code that does not run goes here.
  ```
  ````
- Knit to pdf.
- Git add, commit and push both files (Rmd and PDF).
