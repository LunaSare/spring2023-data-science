- Follow the tutorial [Module 24: An Intro to Phylogenetic Tree Construction in R](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/module-24/module-24.html).

- In a new Rmd document, try to complete as many of the steps from the tutorial as you can.

- Document the parts that are hardest to complete, and how much time it took you to figure out each one.

- If you can't make all parts of the tutorial run, it is ok.

- I just want to see that you tried to run most of them, and if you succed that is great! If not, that is ok too.
