**Day 1: markdown and rmarkdown**
<!-- from https://globalecologybiogeography.github.io/Ecoinformatics/readings/week7_reading/-->

* Prepare a reading for in-class discussion:
  1. Read [The Story in the Notebook: Exploratory Data Science using a Literate Programming Tool](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3173574.3173748)
  <!-- 1.
  [Data Science: A Comprehensive Overview](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3076253) 
  [Enhancing reproducibility for computational methods](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aah6168)
  -->
  2. On your bio project create a new text file called `best_practices.txt`. Stage and commit the file.
  3. In that file, write the following:
     - List down any concepts or words from the paper that you did not know of, along with their definitions.
     - For each number in `Box 1. Summary of Best Practices`, identify and write down the best practices that you have implemented so far, in general and for this class.
     - Stage and commit all changes made to your file.
     - Take a snapshot of your git history and send it to your instructor.
