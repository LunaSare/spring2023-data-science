## A) Prepare for in-class exercises
## The `apply` family of functions

<!-- Written Tutorial:
https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter4.html#:~:text=Apply%20functions%20are%20a%20family,and%20often%20require%20less%20code. -->

<!-- Videos from https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/lessons/R-iteration-1/ -->

**Watching all videos for this section takes ~ 44 min**.

Hint: Watch the videos with a higher reproduction speed to save some time.


> **Instructions**
>
> - Create a new Rmd file, save it in your document folder with the name `"apply-prep.Rmd"`.
> - Write a title for this section (using a first level header, indicated with one hashtag followed by a blank space `# `)
> - After (or during) watching each video, write the code that is being explained by the virtual instructor in your Rmd file.
>   - Write a subtitle before the code section of each video (as a second level header indicated with two hastags followed by a blank space `## `).
>   - Write each piece of code explained in the video in its own R chunk.
>   - ⚠️ If the code gives an error or does not run, you can tell R not to run it by using the option `eval = FALSE` inside the R chunk:
>   ````
>   ```{r, eval = FALSE}
>   your code that does not run goes here.
>   ```
>   ````
> - Knit to pdf.
> - Git add, commit and push both files (Rmd and PDF).
