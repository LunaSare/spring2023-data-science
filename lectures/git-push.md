- To "push" a repository means to **upload** local changes to a remote copy of a repository.
- to do this, we use the command `git push`
- The command `git push` can be run after we have added and committed the changes that we want to upload.
- Note: You can only push to remote repositories that you have been given access to collaborate with!

- **In-class activity 2**: Markdown and Pushing changes to a collaborative repo
  1. Display the contents of the README.md file from the local copy of the markdown-cheatsheet repo that you cloned on the previous activity. You can use the commands `nano`, `cat` or `less`
  1. What is the difference between the file that you see on your terminal and the [file as it is displayed on GitHub](https://github.com/LunaSare/markdown-cheatsheet#readme)?
  1. Create a .txt file named `"Your-Name-markdown-commands.txt"`. Write down the differences that you note from the previous point.
  1. `git add` your file and then `git commit` with a meaningful message.
  1. Make sure that you have accepted the invite to collaborate on the [markdown-cheatsheet](https://github.com/LunaSare/markdown-cheatsheet) repo.
  1. Run the command `git push` to upload the file you added and committed to the remote copy of the repo.
  1. Go to the [home of the repo on GitHub](https://github.com/LunaSare/markdown-cheatsheet) and look at your file there.
