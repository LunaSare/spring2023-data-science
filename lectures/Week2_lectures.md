Day 2

**Live coding: data tables and organizing a project with RStudio**

* Data Carpentry lesson [Starting with data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html):
  - function `download.file()`
  - inbuilt functions vs package functions
  - installing packages: the `tidyverse` package
  - function `tidyverse::read_csv()`
  - functions to read excel tables
  - functions to read google tables
  - functions to explore data structures
    - content: `head()`, `tail()`, and `view()`
    - summary: `str()` and `summary()`
    - size: `dim()`, `nrow()` and `ncol()`
    - names: `names()`, `colnames()`, `rownames()`
  - indexing data frames
  - subsetting data frames
  - Learners (in break out rooms) then instructor: do the [challenge](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html#Challenge12)
  - Learners: do [Activity 1](https://lunasare.github.io/data-science-research-biology/assignments/week2_activities/)

* Factors and formatting dates will be covered later.
