### Setup your RStudio project (5 min)

- üéóÔ∏è Structuring your files into a _project_ is a best practice for good data science!
- Open your _RStudio project_ for the class; I called mine "**spring2023**".
- Open a new file, name it "**functions.Rmd**", and save it to your "**documents**" folder.


### Writing functions (10 min)

- In this lesson we will use the concept of "mass" to learn how to create functions.
- Mass describes the density and type of atoms in any given object.
- The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), though mass can also be measured in grams (gr), ounces (oz), and pounds (lb).
- Reminder - Mass is not the same as weight:
  - Weight is the measure of the force of gravity on an object
  - It is hence a relative measure
  - Mass is an absolute measure
  - The mass of an object will never change, but the weight of an item can change based on its location.

### Using and modifying functions (20 min)

- The length of an organism is strongly correlated with its body
mass.
- This [allometric](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/allometry-the-study-of-biological-scaling-13228439/#:~:text=Allometry%2C%20in%20its%20broadest%20sense,as%20both%20grow%20during%20development.) relationship takes the form of _mass equals to parameter "a" multiplied by "length" elevated to the power of parameter "b"_:

> mass = a * length^b

- Parameters `a` and `b` vary among biological groups.
- Scientists use this formula to estimate the mass of organisms for which we only have length measurememts. For example:
  - trees, we cannot weigh them unless we unroot them,
  - extinct creatures such as dinosaurs, as we cannot get the living weight of something that is fossilized.

- The following function uses the formula `mass = a * length^b` to estimate the mass of an organisms belonging to *Theropoda*
dinosaurs in kg, based on its length in meters and the set of parameter values `a` and `b` that have been estimated for that biological group, `a = 0.73` and `b = 3.63`, by [Seebacher (2001)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171).
  - Take 3 min to type the following function in:
  ```r
  get_mass_from_length_theropoda <- function(length){
      mass <- 0.73 * length ^ 3.63
      return(mass)
    }
    ```

### Why do we use functions in programming? (15 min)

#### Discussion in small groups (5 min)

- Discuss in small groups: Based on your experience with coding so far and after watching the [introductory videos]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/before-reusable-code-1), **how does creating your own functions would improve your coding workflow?**

- Individually, work on your Rmd file:
  - Write a second level subtitle for the introductory section.
  - List and justify three reasons why using functions is useful in data science.

#### Discussion in full (10 min)

- How does creating your own functions will improve your code?

- Makes code more understandable:
  - Code is shorter, easier to remember
  - Code is more organized for you and others, so it is easier to read
  - Code is grouped conceptually, easier to understand
  - Code is more manageable, invites you to be intentional on the code that you are writing
  - Allows to be more in control of the outputs
- Makes code reusable:
  - It allows reusing code for other parts of a project or a future project
  - It is less error prone than copy-pasting code
    - If it occurs in more than one place, it will eventually be wrong somewhere.
  - It is more efficient than copy-pasting code
    - Functions are written to be reusable.

### Defining argument values in a function (20 min)

- In the previous exercise, you created the function `get_mass_from_length()` which is a more flexible form of `get_mass_from_length_theropoda()`, by allowing `a` and `b` to be passed as arguments.
- Still, for some organisms we don't have specific values of `a` and `b`. In this case, we have to use values of `a` and `b` that can be applied generally.
- We can give this general values as _default values_ for some or all arguments in any function that we are creating.

### Combining functions (20 min)

- The metric system is the standard approach used in scientific practice.
- To communicate scientific results to a broader audience, it might be more impactful to use different units (at least in some countries).

  - Combining functions in a nested way
  - Calling functions inside functions
- Homework


### Setup your RStudio project (5 min)

- üéóÔ∏è Structuring your files into a _project_ is a best practice for good data science!
- Open your _RStudio project_ for the class; I called mine "**fall-2022**".
- Open a new file, name it "**choices.Rmd**", and save it to your "**documents**" folder.

### Review: Logical and conditional statements (15 min)

- Statements that return logical values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)
  - logical operators
  - conditional operators
  - logical functions


#### Exercise 6: [Practice logical and conditional statements]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Making-choices-choice-operators-R)

<!-- https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/exercises/Making-choices-choice-operators-R -->

### Basic `if` statement (10 min)

- A simple `if` statement allows us to choose between a single option and its alternative.

#### Exercise 7: [Handling one choice]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Making-choices-if-statements-R-1)

<!-- https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/exercises/Making-choices-basic-if-statements-R -->

---

### The `if`/`else` statement (10 min)

- An `else` statement allows us to choose between two options and its alternative.

#### Exercise 8: [Handling 2 choices]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Making-choices-if-statements-R-2)

<!-- https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/exercises/Making-choices-basic-if-statements-R -->

---

### The `if`/`else if`/`else` statement (10 min)

- An `else if` statement allows us to choose between three or more options and an alternative.

#### Exercise 9: [Handling 3 choices or more]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Making-choices-if-statements-R-3)

---

### Using conditions inside functions (30 min)

- We can use conditions inside functions
- Conditions alter the behavior of a functions
- Conditions give us more control on the behavior of a function

#### Exercise 10: [Value of `y` by age class]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Making-choices-if-statements-R-4) (10 min)

- Conditions allow us to be even more efficient in reusing code
  - For example, we can consolidate all the functions we created to get the mass of a dinosaur into a single one.
