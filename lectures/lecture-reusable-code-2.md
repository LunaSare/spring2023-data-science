### Review

- Question from last class: To get all the functions within a family, we can use the function `methods()`

```
methods(is)
methods(summary)
methods(summarize)
```

### Setup your RStudio project (5 min)

- üéóÔ∏è Structuring your files into a _project_ is a best practice for good data science!
- Open your _RStudio project_ for the class; I called mine "**fall-2022**".
- Open a new file, name it "**loops.Rmd**", and save it to your "**documents**" folder.

### Basics of `for` loops

### Looping over functions

#### Exercise 2: [Mass of dinosaurs with loops]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Loops-size-estimates-by-name-loop-R) (30 min)

We did not hav etime to cover this during class, students required more time to assimilate the structure of loops to fully understand it and be bale to apply it by themselves.

Moved this exercise to review week:
