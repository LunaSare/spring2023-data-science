### Quizz (10 min)

Answer the following questions on the [etherpad]({{ site.etherpad }}):

1. What type of output does the `summarize()` function from `dplyr` give, a table or a vector?
2. When using the `summarize()` function, does the output table has the same columns as the input data table or  different?
3. Mention 3 functions from the `dplyr` package that return tables with (at least) the same columns from the input table?

### Setup your RStudio project (15 min)

* Remember! Working in projects is considered a best practice in data science.
* Go ahead and open your RStudio project for the class. I called mine **sprng2023**.
* We will keep on working on the data set from
  - the [Portal Project Teaching Database](https://www.weecology.org/data-projects/portal-teaching-db/).
- If you have not downloaded the following CSV files, do so by clicking on their names:
  - [surveys.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172) - main table, one row for each rodent captured, date on date,
    location, species ID, sex, and weight in grams and hindfoot length in millimeters.
  - [species.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483) - latin species names for each species ID + general taxon
  - [plots.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474) - information on the experimental manipulations at the site
- Make sure that the three CSV files are saved into your **data-raw** folder.
- Create a new Rmd file named `"joining-tables.Rmd"` and save it in your `Documents` folder.
- Load the 3 tables into `R` using the function `read.csv()` from the package `utils`.
    - Remember to use relative paths!
```r
surveys <- read.csv("surveys.csv")
species <- read.csv("species.csv")
plots <- read.csv("plots.csv")
```

* Once loaded, we can display the files as a data table by clicking on their name in the "Environment" tab.
* This data set is a great example of a good tabular data structure
    * One table per type of data
        * Tables can be linked together to combine information.
    * Each row contains a single record.
        * A single observation or data point
    * Each column or field contains a single attribute.
        * A single type of information

### Why do we need to join data tables? (5 min)

- One of the best practices in data science is to structure data from the same project/experiment in multiple tables:
  - It is recommended to have one main table (the `surveys` table in our case) and multiple supplementary tables that provide additional details.
- The practical reasons why data scientists do this are:
    - it avoids redundant information (like listing the full taxonomy for every individual of a species),
    - it makes storage more efficient (smaller files),
    - it makes data processing more efficient (such as changing data in one place, not hundreds of places),
    - it makes tables more readable, as they contain a single kind of information.
- So, having data in multiple tables means that we often need to join them to perform an analysis.

### Joining two data Tables (5 min)

- To combine two tables based on the values from a shared column, we use the `dplyr` functions
  - `inner_join()`
  - `left_join()`
  - `right_join()`
  - `full_join()`
- These functions take at least three arguments:
  - The first two arguments specify the two tables that we want to join.
  - The third argument `by = ` specifies the name of the shared column as a character string (enclosed in quotations `" "`)
  - For example, to join the tables `surveys` and `species` by their only shared column `"species_id"` into a new `combined` table:
  ```r
  inner_join(surveys, species, by = "species_id")
  ```
  - The same, but with a pipe:
  ```r
  surveys |>
    inner_join(species, by = "species_id")
  ```

### Exercise 1 (10 min)
<!-- https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/blob/main/exercises/Portal-data-joins-R.md -->
Do the following calculations using a single pipe of code (no nested nor intermediate variables):
- Use `inner_join()` and `filter()` to get a data frame with the information from the `surveys` and `plots` tables where the `"plot_type"` is `"Control"`.

#### Check dropped data

- The function `nrow()` let us see the row numbers from the original tables and the joined tables:
```r
nrow(surveys)
nrow(combined)
```
- We can test if the row number has changed:
```r
nrow(surveys) == nrow(combined)
```
- inner joins: only keep information from both tables when both tables have a matching value in the join column
  - Rows with `"species_id"` values from the first table that are not in the second table (and visceversa) are dropped:
  ![Illustration of an inner join showing two tables being joined.
  First table has 1, 2, 3 in column 1 and x1, x2, x3 in column 2.
  Second table has 1, 2, 4, in column 1 and y1, y2, y4 in column 2.
  Combined table has 1 and 2 in column 1, x1 and x2 in column 2, and y1 and y2 in column 3.
  ]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/inner-join.gif)  
- left joins: The function `left_join()` keeps all values from the _left table_ (the first table given in the function).
- right joins: `right_join()` keeps all values from the _right table_ (the second table given in the function).
- full joins: keep all information from both tables.

#### Finding shared column names (`colnames()`) between tables (5 min)

- How do we find shared column names to join our tables??
1. We can visually search for shared column names between two tables:
  - We can open each table from the _Environment_ tab, or with the function `View()`
  - We can display the `colnames()` of each table individually
2. Using code!
  - The function `intersect()`:
  ```r
  intersect(colnames(surveys), colnames(species))
  ```

### Exercise 2 (10 min)
<!-- https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/blob/main/exercises/Portal-data-joins-R.md -->
1. Find the column name that is shared between the `plots` table and the `surveys` table. Use that column name for the next question.
2. Do the following using a single pipe of code (no nested code nor intermediate variables):
  - Use function `inner_join()` and `filter()` to get a data frame with the information from the `surveys` and `plots` tables where the `"plot_type"` is `"Control"`.


### Joining two or more data Tables (5 min)

- There is no special function to join more than two data tables.
- We use the `_join()` functions, incrementally:
  - Start by joining two tables
  - Then, join the resulting table to a third table, and so on.
  - For example, for the Portal data set, we can start by joining the surveys and the species tables together, and then combining the resulting table with the plots table:
```r
combined <- inner_join(surveys, species, by = "species_id")
combined_final <- inner_join(combined, plots, by = "plot_id")
```
- Now, how do we do this using a pipe?
```r
combined <- surveys |>
  inner_join(species, by = "species_id") |>
  inner_join(plots, by = "plot_id")
```

### Exercise 3 (15 min)
<!-- https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/blob/main/exercises/Portal-data-dplyr-review-R.md -->
We want to do an analysis comparing the size of individuals on the `"Control"` plots to the `"Long-term Krat Exclosures"`.
 - Create a data frame with the `"year"`, `"genus"`, `"species"`, `"weight"` and `"plot_type"` for all cases where the
 - plot type is either `"Control"` or `"Long-term Krat Exclosure"`. Pay attention to typos in lower case and upper case values.
 - Only include cases where the column `"taxa"` is `"Rodent"`.
 - Remove any records where the `"weight"` is missing.

### A Relationship Between Data Frames and Vectors

* R is a programming language for data anlysis
* It stores information using data structures
* We've learned about two general ways to store data, _vectors_ and _data frames_
* What are vectors: Vectors store a single set of values with the same type
* What are data frames: Data frames store multiple sets of values, one in each column, that can have different types
* These two ways of storing data are related to one another
  * Actually, all data structures in R are related to each other!
* A data frame is a bunch of equal length vectors that are grouped together
* So, we can extract vectors from data frames and we can also make data frames from vectors

### Creating vectors
<!--
- Examples of numeric vectors:
  - with a single number
  ```r
  a_number <- 1
  ```
  - with two or more numbers, we can use the _concatenate_ function `c()`
  ```r
  c(1, 2, 3) # in order
  ```
- We can use the _colon_ `:` operator to create sequences of numbers
  ```r
  1:3
  ```
  - With the `c()` function we can add numbers in any order we want
  ```r
  c(10, 1, 8) # random order
  ```
  - But with `:` we can create sequences as long as we want to with just a few key strokes:
  ```r
  1:10
  1:100
  1:4589567
  ```
  - The function `seq()` creates sequences with any step we specify (not only 1 as with `:`)
  ```r
  seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)
  seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 0.5)
  ```
  - We can start numeric sequences at any number, in reverse order, and using negative numbers,
    - with the `:` operator:
    ```r
    15:20
    100:50
    -100:50
    5:-5
    ```
    - and with `seq()` (pay attention to the sign of the step (`by = ` argument))
    ```r
    seq(15, 20)
    seq(100, 50, -2)
    seq(-100, 50, 2)
    ```

2. Examples of logical vectors
  ```r
  abc
  ``` -->

### Creating data frames from Vectors

* The `data.frame()` function joins vectors into a single data frame
* Each argument we provide will be a column in the data frame (just like in `mutate()` and `summarize()`!)
* The arguments are taken as follows:
  - The name of the column we want in the data frame,
  - an equal sign `=`, and
  - the vector whose values we want in that column.
* So we give it the arguments `sites = `, and `density = `
 ```r
density_data <- data.frame(sites = c("a", "a", "b", "c"), density = c(2.8, 3.2, 1.5, 3.8))
```

* If we look in the **Global Environment** tab we can see that there is a new data frame called `density_data`, and that it has our two vectors as columns.
* We could also make this data frame using the vectors that are already stored in variables:
```r
sites <- c("a", "a", "b", "c")
density <- c(2.8, 3.2, 1.5, 3.8)
density_data <- data.frame(sites = sites, density = density)
```

* We can also add columns to the data from that only include a single value without first creating a vector
* We do this by providing a name for the new column, an equals sign, and the value that we want to occur in every row
* For example, if all of this data was collected in the same year and we wanted to add that year as a column in our data frame we could do it like this:

```r
density_data_year <- data.frame(year = 2000, sites = sites, density = density)
```

* `year =` sets the name of the column in the data frame
* And 2000 is that value that will occur on every row of that column
* If we run this and look at the `density_data_year` data frame we'll see that it includes the year column with the value `2000` in every row

### Exercise 6

<!-- > Do [Building data frames from vectors]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/building-data-frames-from-vectors-R/). -->
You have data on the length, width, and height of 10 individuals of the yew *Taxus baccata* stored in the following vectors:

```r
length <- c(2.2, 2.1, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, 2.5, 1.9, 1.1, 3.5, 2.9)
width <- c(1.3, 2.2, 1.5, 4.5, 3.1, NA, 1.8, 0.5, 2.0, 2.7)
height <- c(9.6, 7.6, 2.2, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.3, 7.5, 3.2)
```

- Make a data frame that contains these three vectors as columns along with a `"genus"` column containing the genus name *Taxus* on all rows and a `"species"` column containing the species epithet *baccata* on all rows.

### Extracting values from vectors and data frames

#### Extracting vectors from data frames

* There are several ways to extract a vector from a data frame
* Let's look at these using the Portal data
* We'll start by loading the `surveys` table into R

```r
surveys <- read.csv("surveys.csv")
```

* One common approach to extracting a column into a vector is to use the `[]`
* Remember that `[]` also mean "give me a piece of something"
* Let's get the `species_id` column
* `"species_id"` has to be in quotes because we we aren't using `dplyr`

```r
surveys["species_id"]
```

* This actually returns a one column data frame, not a vector
* To extract a single column as a vector we use two sets of `[]`
* Think of the second set of `[]` as getting the single vector from inside the one column data frame

```r
surveys[["species_id"]]
```

* We can also do this using `$`
* The `$` in R is short hand for `[[]]` in cases where the piece we want to get has a name
* So, we start with the object we want a part of, our `surveys` data frame
* Then the `$` with no spaces around it
* and then the name of the `species_id` column (without quotes, just to be confusing)

```r
surveys$species_id
```

### Exercise 7

<!-- > Do [Extracting vectors from data frames]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/extracting-vectors-from-data-frames-R/). -->
Using the Portal data `surveys` table ([download a copy](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172) if it's not in your working directory):

1. Use `$` to extract the `weight` column into a vector called `surveys_weight`
2. Use `[]` to extract the `month` column into a vector called `surveys_month`
3. Extract the `hindfoot_length` column into a vector and calculate the mean hindfoot length ignoring missing values.

### Extracting Values from Vectors

```r
letters[10] # indexing the 10th letter of the alphabet
letters[1:3] # getting the first three letters
abc <- letters[c(1,2,3)] # creating a vector of the first three letters of the alphabet
letters[3:1] #
letters[-1]
letters[-1:5]
```

### Overwriting values in vectors and data frames

### Summary

* A data frame is a set of equal length vectors
* We can extract a column of a data frame into a vector using either `$` or two sets of square brackets `[[]]`
* We can combine vectors into data frames using the `data.frame()` function, which takes a series of arguments, one vector for each column we want to create in the data frame.
