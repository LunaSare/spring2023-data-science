> **Learning Objectives**
>
> This week, students will be able to:
>
> - list the elements of the data life cycle
> - articulate the relevance of good data management for scientific research
> - identify the differences between good and bad data entry and management
> - recognize bad data organization and why it is problematic for research
> - implement quality assurance and control measures for data entry in spreadsheets using excel
> - list current measures used by the scientific community in ecology and evolution to preserve data long term

## Day 1
### Welcome!

* Introductions
* Why are you taking this class? What do you expect from it?

### Pre-class survey:

- Take 5 min to complete the survey on this [Google Form]](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXzFNSegtfIuAPTK9LEwSmYKhPk_Fs8GPFXRjia5DNZaJTtg/viewform).

### Syllabus overview

* Go through the syllabus
* Do you have any questions about it?
* Choose grading scheme
* Choose office hours

### Schedule overview

The schedule shows a list of topics that will be covered each week of the course.

The schedule reflects the flipped course structure, and organizes homework and in-class activities by topic:

* Before Class
  - Prepare: Readings or activities to dive into the topic before class

* Lectures/live-coding
  - Lecture notes used in class
	- Not expected to be read in advance; may be useful for review
	- May not match lecture precisely

* In-class activities
  - Individually or jointly
  - A challenge that will support the construction of a mental model of your own
	- May require additional work time after class

* After-class
  - Strengthen: Exercises to strengthen and evaluate concepts discussed during class


### Exercises

1. Take 10 min to read [8 Steps in the Data Life Cycle](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-life-cycle)   
    - What is the importance of the data life cycle?
    - How is it related to research?

3. Take 10 min to read [The DataONE Life Cycle](https://www.dataone.org/data-life-cycle). If the link is not available, a screen shot of the text is available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/dataone-data-life-cycle).
    - How many steps are there in the DataOne life cycle? Summarize the steps.

2. Look at [Figure 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/f1000res-2017-paper) from research paper [Best practice data life cycle approaches for the life sciences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069748/).
    - Take 5 min to identify what steps are similar and different across the three data life cycle approaches you have reviewed so far.

### In class group activity

- Follow instructions on this [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1T7MKWvtgBZuLa_LjGg02GAjySPQtHj1iwf9sdupfkoU/viewer?f=3).


### Homework

- Create your own data life cycle on this [jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1giFAdjGzPK9vMM8aLuGP5KwF_FzyyT5hJ3eoPslS3rU/viewer?f=5).

**A minute feedback**

- Provide some quick feedback for this session [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRETx27OK9PJlTd8djqySqrRa5ZMDTiUizF_vXuau82nASqQ/viewform)

## Day 2

### Lecture: Best practices for data entry and quality assurance using excel

**In-class discussion of reading for Day 2**
  - showcase data repository websites (GenBank, GBIF, Dryad, Zenodo)


**Live coding: Lesson [Quality Assurance and Control](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/04-quality-control)**
- What is the difference between quality assurance and quality control.
- Quality assurance
  - Demo data validation in excel using this data file [figshare.com/files/2252083](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083). Students **download** it to their computer, too, and follow along.
- Quality control
  - Saving a copy of the original raw data is key.
  - Start a README file describing the documents you create in your project.
    - Use a template following readme best practices from https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme
  - Sorting to check for invalid data: [Exercise 1](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/04-quality-control/#exercise)
    - Ensure that data sorting is expanded to the whole data table, so data is not corrupted.
  - Conditional formatting to scan data for outliers: [Exercise 2](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/04-quality-control/#exercise-1)
    - Use this cautiously, it might corrupt the data.

**In-class exercises**

- [Instructions]({{ site.baseurl}}/assignments/week1_activities/) and group activities.

**A minute feedback**
- Provide some quick feedback for this session [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRETx27OK9PJlTd8djqySqrRa5ZMDTiUizF_vXuau82nASqQ/viewform).
