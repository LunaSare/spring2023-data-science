## Course Description

This is a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in using data science to address research questions of biological significance in ecology and evolution. The course will focus on bioinformatic and phylogenetic methods, using state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical skills to design appropriate analyses to describe and explain general patterns in the species distribution and evolutionary history of organisms. Special attention will be given to phylogenetic patterns of biodiversity and their basis in both ecological (dispersal, competition) and evolutionary (speciation, extinction) processes.
The course will be conducted seminar style and student-centered. Most of the reading will be drawn from recent primary literature.
The application of research methods using published data, computational tools, and best practices in reproducibility to address questions in ecology and evolution, will be an integral part of this course.
Students will communicate their results in written, oral and visual formats.

## Course Goals and Learning Objectives

**Goals**

* Data and how to do scientific research with it
* Data entry -> Data storage -> Data manipulation -> Data visualization
* Not statistics

**Learning Objectives**

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Apply fundamental data science skills to answer broad research questions in ecology and/or evolution.
* Write simple computer programs in R.
* Understand how to organise, explore and visualise biological data.
* Reproduce analyses in ecology and evolution.
* Organise and keep track of research projects using version control.
* Have an overview of the main concepts in phylogenetics.

---

## Teaching methods

* Flipped classroom: I do, we do, you do
  - You don't learn how to ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it and the same is true for data science
* Peer instruction
  - Interact with each other during in-class activities and (if possible) when doing homework
  - You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from the instructor

---

## Our flipped course structure

* Homework before class: readings and exercises that will prepare you for class.
* Lecture:
  - I will lecture while reviewing homework together, and demo the concept using live coding
* In-class activities
  - We will work on an associated exercise together in class
  - Then, you will work on an exercise in class
* Homework after class: You will work on additional exercises and your project on your own (both in & out of class)

* Turn-in work: Related to your research project

* Optional homework and in-class activities: adds points to final(?) grades
