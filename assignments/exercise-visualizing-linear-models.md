We want to compare the circumference to height relationship in acacia to the same relationship for all trees in the region. These data are stored in two different tables. Make a graph with the relationship between `CIRC` and `HEIGHT` for all trees as gray circles in the background and the same relationship for acacia as red circles plotted on top of the gray circles. Scale both axes logarithmically. Include a linear model fitting for both sets of data, trying different linear models specified using the argument `method =`. Provide clear labels for the axes.

Your plot should look something like [this](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/solutions/Graphing-data-from-multiple-tables-R.jpeg).

Once your are done with the exercises:

1. Save your .Rmd file and knit to PDF.
1. Add the two files, commit and push to GitHub
1. Let your instructor know that changes have been published on GitHub
